This class is designed to simulate a Python \"Read-Eval-Print Loop\" (REPL), which is the interactive Python interpreter you get when you type python in your terminal. It allows you to execute Python code programmatically and capture its output.\n",

        "* `self.locals_dict = {}`: This line initializes another instance variable called locals_dict. This dictionary will store the \"local\" variables created during the execution of the Python code. In a typical REPL, variables defined in one line are available in subsequent lines. This dictionary helps simulate that persistent state.\n",
        "* `self.execution_history = []`: This initializes an empty list that will store a record of all the code executed by this tool, along with its output, return value, and any errors. This allows you to review past interactions with the REPL.\n",

        "\n",
        "Define a tool that allows an AI (or any part of your program) to run Python code interactively.\n",
        "\n",
        " * `name=\"python_repl\"`: This gives the tool a short, `descriptive name: python_repl`. An AI agent would refer to this tool by this name when deciding to execute Python code.\n",
        " * `description=\"Execute Python code and return both the code and its output.\n",
        " * `Maintains state between executions.`: This is a crucial part. It provides a human-readable (and, more importantly, machine-readable for an AI) explanation of what the python_repl tool does.\n",
        " * `\"Execute Python code and return both the code and its output\"`: Clearly states the primary action and what to expect as a result.\n",
        " * `\"Maintains state between executions\"`: This is a very important detail! It tells the AI that if it defines a variable in one call to `python_repl`, that variable will still exist and be accessible in a subsequent call. This is directly supported by your `PythonREPLTool's` `self.globals_dict` and `self.locals_dict`.\n",
        " * `func=python_repl.run`: This assigns the actual Python function that will be executed when this tool is called.\n",
        " * `python_repl`: This variable refers to an instance of your PythonREPLTool class (e.g., repl = PythonREPLTool() from our previous examples). So, python_repl would be an object like repl.\n",
        " * `.run`: This is the specific method within that `PythonREPLTool` instance that takes a string of Python code and executes it, returning a formatted string with the code, output, and any errors.\n",
        "\n",
        " In essence, python_tool is like giving your AI a direct console to type Python commands into and get results back, remembering everything it's done so far.\n",

        " ## Explaining the `validation_tool` Definition\n",
        " This defines a tool for checking the accuracy or properties of previous computational results.\n",

        "  * `description=\"Validate the results of previous computations with specific test cases and expected properties.\":`\n",

        "  * `func=lambda query: validator.validate_mathematical_result(query, {})`:\n",
        "    * This is where it gets a little more nuanced due to the `lambda` function.\n",
        "    * `lambda query:`: This defines a small, anonymous function. This `lambda` function takes one argument, query.\n",
        "     * In many tool frameworks, tools are expected to take a single string argument from the AI (often called query or input) which the AI uses to convey its intent.\n",
        "     * `validator:` This refers to an instance of your `ResultValidator` class\n",
        "     * `.validate_mathematical_result(query, {})`: This is the method from your `ResultValidator` class that gets called.\n",
        "      * `query`: The lambda passes the query (the input from the AI) as the description argument to `validate_mathematical_result`. This means the AI can tell the validator what it's validating.\n",
        "      * `{}`: This is the key part that simplifies it for a basic tool. It passes an empty dictionary `{}` as the `expected_properties` argument.\n",
        " `What this implies:` This specific validation_tool as defined here will only run the `validate_mathematical_result` function with an empty set of expected properties. This means it might extract numbers and give basic info, but it won't perform any actual checks against specific values unless the `validate_mathematical_result` method itself has default checks, or this tool is primarily meant to just parse and show the numbers."

        "# Explanation of prompt_template\n",
        "This entire block is a multi-line string that defines the `\"persona\"` and `\"instructions\"` for your AI agent. It tells the LLM how to behave and what its capabilities are.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `You are Claude, an advanced AI assistant with Python execution and result validation capabilities.:`\n",
        "\n",
        " * `Purpose:` This is the system instruction or persona setting. It tells the AI model what role it should embody `(\"Claude\")` and what its core abilities are. This helps the LLM align its responses and reasoning with the defined role.\n",
        "\n",
        " * `Impact:` When the LLM receives this, it understands it has two key functionalities: `\"Python execution\"` and `\"result validation.\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `You can execute Python code to solve complex problems and then validate your results to ensure accuracy.:`\n",
        "\n",
        " * `Purpose`: Reinforces the capabilities mentioned above and emphasizes the purpose of those capabilities – solving problems and ensuring accuracy. This is a subtle hint that emphasizes validation is important.\n",
        "3. `Available tools: {tools}:`\n",
        "\n",
        " * `Purpose`: This is a placeholder `({tools})`. When the `PromptTemplate` is rendered, this placeholder will be dynamically filled with information about the tools the AI has access to.\n",
        " * `How it works (with partial_variables below)`: The `partial_variables` section of your PromptTemplate provides the string `\"python_repl - Execute Python codenresult_validator - Validate computation results\"`. So, when the prompt is sent to the LLM, it will literally see:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    Available tools:\n",
        "    python_repl - Execute Python code\n",
        "    result_validator - Validate computation results\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        " * `Impact`: This gives the LLM the names and descriptions of the tools it can use, helping it decide which tool is appropriate for a given task.\n",
        "\n",
        " * `Use this format:`:\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: This is a strict instruction on the expected output format from the LLM. This is critical for agentic setups. The external code that runs the agent (often called the `\"agent executor\"` or `\"orchestrator\"`) will parse the LLM's output based on this exact format to identify when the LLM wants to perform an `\"Action\"` (use a tool) or has a `\"Final Answer.\"`\n",
        " * `Question`: the input question you must answer:\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: Shows the LLM where the user's initial question will appear.\n",
        " * `Thought: analyze what needs to be done:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: Instructs the LLM to start its reasoning process by explaining its thinking. This makes the agent's behavior more transparent and helps the LLM chain its thoughts logically.\n",
        " * `Action: {tool_names}:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: Instructs the LLM that when it wants to use a tool, it should output `Action: \"` followed by the name of the tool it wishes to use.\n",
        "    * `How it works (with partial_variables)`: The partial_variables will replace `{tool_names}` with `\"python_repl, result_validator\"`.\n",
        " *  `Action Input: [your input]:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: Instructs the LLM that after choosing an action, it must provide the input for that tool. For `python_repl`, this would be the Python code. For `result_validator`, it would be the description/validation parameters.\n",
        " * `Observation: [result]:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: This is where the output from the executed tool will be inserted back into the prompt by the agent executor. The LLM then `\"observes\"` this result and can continue its reasoning. This is how the agent `\"sees\"` the effects of its actions.\n",
        "  * `... (repeat Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation as needed):`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: Explicitly tells the LLM that this problem-solving process can be iterative. It can go through multiple cycles of thinking, acting, and observing until the problem is solved.\n",
        "  * `Thought: I should validate my results`:\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: A specific instruction to guide the LLM's thought process towards validation. This reinforces the importance of the `result_validator` tool.\n",
        "  * `Action: [validation if needed]:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: Instructs the LLM to call the validation tool when appropriate.\n",
        "  * `Action Input: [validation parameters]:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose` : The specific parameters for the validation tool.\n",
        "  * `Observation: [validation results]:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: Where the output of the validation tool will be inserted.\n",
        "  * `Thought: I now have the complete answer:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose:` Instructs the LLM to signal when it believes it has finished the task.\n",
        "  * `Final Answer: [comprehensive answer with validation confirmation]:`\n",
        "     * `Purpose`: The final, comprehensive answer that the LLM provides to the user, ideally confirming any validations performed.\n",
        "  * `Question: {input}:`\n",
        "     * `Purpose`: Another placeholder ({input}) where the actual user query for the agent will be inserted.\n",
        "  * `{agent_scratchpad}:`\n",
        "    * `Purpose`: This is a crucial placeholder. The `agent_scratchpad` is where the history of the `Thought`, `Action`, `Action Input`, and `Observation` steps during the current turn will be built up and inserted. It serves as the agent's \"memory\" or \"scratchpad\" for the current interaction, allowing the LLM to see its previous steps and their results.\n",

        "   * `partial_variables={ ... }:`\n",
        "     * These are variables that are pre-filled or fixed within the `PromptTemplate` when it's defined. They are not expected to change during subsequent calls.\n",
        "      * `\"tools\": \"python_repl - Execute Python codenresult_validator - Validate computation results\"`: As explained before, this string provides the detailed list of tools and their descriptions that the LLM will see. The \\n creates a newline.\n",
        "      * `\"tool_names\": \"python_repl, result_validator\"`: This provides a comma-separated list of the tool names. As noted, the placement of {tool_names} in the Action: line might be slightly non-standard for strict parsing, but it serves to remind the LLM of the available names. A more common format would be Action: <tool_name>.\n",

If it is, it sets an environment variable named ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. LangChain's `ChatAnthropic` class (and many other LLM integrations) typically looks for this environment variable to authenticate with the Anthropic API. This is a secure way to manage API keys without hardcoding them.\n",

        " * This initializes the Large Language Model (LLM) component of your agent.\n",

        " * `model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\"`: Specifies the exact Claude model to use. \"Claude 3 Opus\" is Anthropic's most powerful model at the time of this explanation, known for its strong reasoning and intelligence.\n",
        " * `temperature=0` : Controls the randomness of the LLM's output. A temperature of 0 makes the output more deterministic and factual, which is generally desired for code execution and validation tasks where correctness is paramount. Higher temperatures lead to more creative but potentially less reliable output.\n",
        " * `max_tokens=4000`: Sets the maximum number of tokens (words/sub-words) that the LLM is allowed to generate in a single response. This helps control costs and prevent excessively long outputs.\n",
